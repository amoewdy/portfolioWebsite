                     In community psychological service centers in China, most volunteers are not trained professionally.The number of professional counselors is small and the consulting fee is high.People don't have enough professional information and services to help them deal with mental disorders.

                According to the social survey, 98.1% of people are faced with psychological distress, but about 40 percent choose to let the problem grow or insist that professional psychological services are not required. People relieve psychological problems mainly through leisure and entertainment, but that doesn't solve the problem.

                            I'm afraid that other people might think I am too weak, and I also agree that seeking help is a sign of weakness. They might say "We have experienced these. Do not be so hypocritical " or "It’s such a small problem". It seems like everyone else is strong and able to handle these problems.<br/>
                            Still, when you get sick you can not only go to the hospital, but also find home medicine boxes. I really want to deal with emotional problems in a private way.

                Sandplay is a powerful therapeutic technique that facilitates the psyche’s natural capacity for healing.<br/>
                In a “free and protected” space provided by the analyst, a client creates a concrete manifestation of his or her imaginal world using sand, water, and miniature objects.<br/>
                In this way Sandplay helps honor and illuminate the client’s internal symbolic world and provides a place for its expression within a safe container, the tray filled with sand. With sufficient time and understanding, this experience can lead to the development of a new psychic structure of the personality.
