                    - The increase in children’s workload makes them stay seated for longer. Their sitting postures are generally incorrect, but the utilization rate of sitting position corrector is low.

                We detect the pressure when children is doing writing, painting and reading in order to obtain pressure data under the natural state, take videos and use the coordinate to record the bending degree so as to analyze the pressure value in oblique and bending situations.<br>
                <b>Assumption</b><br>
                - The sitting position and body pressure are quite different when children perform different tasks<br>
                - We can speculate the sitting position of children through the pressure data sampling of a cushion plane<br>

                Taking records of:<br>
                - Bacis physical information of children<br>

                <h4>Conclusion</h4>
                <p>
                Through the quantitative analysis of sitting postures and pressure figures, we came to three conclusions:<br/>
                1. When children are in reading, writing or painting, the pressure data is not very different. This shows that <b>learning scenarios do not need to be further divided</b>. <br/>
                2. Compared with sitting position, the relative position of children has a greater impact than sitting postures on pressure data. The <b>shape of the cushion should be able to fix the relative position of children sitting on it</b>.<br/>
                3. It is difficult to determine the degree of curvature of the back of a child only through the pressure data sampling of the cushion plane, so the <b>sample points should also be set on the backrest</b>.

                <h4>Mobile App Design</h4>  
                <p>
                We placed six membrane pressure sensors in the cushion as sampling points, and their readings corresponded to six sectors in the app. We also collected the pressure distribution when children sat on it in normal sitting position and set it as the initial value. 
                When using iCushion, the greater the deviation from the initial values for the six sample points, the lower the score in the app.
